# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system can classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, assisting in identifying and preventing financial fraud.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction records, with each record labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Goal**: Build a model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms.

The project is implemented using Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to run without requiring a local setup. Simply upload the dataset and execute the cells in the provided notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
